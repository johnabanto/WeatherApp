This project we got introduced to API's and were tasked to incorporate AngularJS features of a factory and controller. It was challenging at first to get a grasp of how to pull the data that I needed for from the weather API as well as how to connect the controller and factory. It was definitely rewarding when I was able to grab the data that I wanted from the API and was the first time I really relied on using the console log to check if I was getting back what I wanted.
